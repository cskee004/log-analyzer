## Security Log Analyzer & Agent Observability Platform

### Requirements

* Ruby 3.2 or higher
* Rails 8.0 or higher

---

### Description

This project started as a Ruby on Rails application that parses and analyzes Linux system logs (`auth.log`). It extracts key security events, summarizes event patterns by date and hour, and visualizes the data through a dashboard interface.

The project is now evolving into an **Agent Observability Platform** — a control plane for monitoring autonomous AI agents. The existing log analysis features remain in place while new agent telemetry features are being built alongside them.

This project is part of a personal portfolio and demonstrates experience with Ruby, Rails, log analysis, data visualization, OpenTelemetry-inspired design, security-focused software engineering, and AI-assisted development using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

### Features

#### Security Log Analysis
* Upload and parse `auth.log` system logs
* Detect and classify key event types:
  * Error flags
  * Authentication failures
  * Invalid users
  * Failed password attempts
  * Disconnects
  * Accepted publickey/passwords
  * Session open/closes
  * Sudo usage
* Event grouping by severity (high/medium/ops)
* Hourly and daily time-based summaries
* Top IPs triggering high-severity events
* Graphs powered by ApexCharts
* Modular design (LogParser, LogUtility, LogFileAnalyzer)

#### Agent Observability Platform
* Trace → Span data model inspired by OpenTelemetry
* Canonical span types: `agent_run_started`, `model_call`, `model_response`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `decision`, `error`, `run_completed`
* Synthetic telemetry simulator for generating realistic agent traces without live agents
* REST API for agent registration and telemetry ingestion (see [API](#api))
* Database-backed `traces` and `spans` tables with referential integrity

### Dev Notes

#### Log Analyzer
- Parsing logic lives in `LogParser` and `LogUtility` (`app/lib/`)
- Analysis is performed by `LogFileAnalyzer` (`app/lib/`)
- Controller: `DashboardController`
- Partial views handle AJAX-based updates for summary and graphs

#### Agent Telemetry
- Data model: **Trace** (one complete agent run) → **Spans** (individual steps within a trace)
- Ingestion logic lives in `TelemetryIngester` (`app/lib/`)
- Simulator components live in `simulator/`: `agent_simulator`, `trace_generator`, `span_generator`
- API controllers live in `app/controllers/api/v1/`

---

### Usage

#### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskee004/log-analyzer.git
cd log-analyzer
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate
rails server
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the web interface.

#### Uploading a Log File

1. Navigate to the dashboard homepage
2. Upload a Linux `auth.log` file using the form
   - Test files are located in `/data`
3. View summary statistics and graphs from parsed results

---

### API

All API endpoints are under `/api/v1`. Telemetry submission requires a Bearer token obtained via key registration.

#### Register an API key

```
POST /api/v1/keys
Content-Type: application/json

{ "agent_type": "support-agent" }
```

Response `201 Created`:
```json
{
  "token": "<your-token>",
  "agent_type": "support-agent",
  "message": "Store this token securely — it will not be shown again."
}
```

> The token is returned **once**. Store it immediately.

Valid `agent_type` values: `support-agent`, `research-agent`, `automation-agent`, `triage-agent`, `data-agent`, `monitoring-agent`, `code-agent`, `notification-agent`

---

#### Validate a token

```
POST /api/v1/auth/token
Content-Type: application/json

{ "token": "<your-token>" }
```

Response `200 OK`:
```json
{ "valid": true, "agent_type": "support-agent" }
```

---

#### Submit telemetry

```
POST /api/v1/telemetry
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: text/plain

{"trace_id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8","agent_id":"support-agent","task_name":"classify_customer_ticket","start_time":"2026-04-02T12:00:00Z","status":"success"}
{"trace_id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8","span_id":"s1","parent_span_id":null,"span_type":"agent_run_started","timestamp":"2026-04-02T12:00:01Z","agent_id":"support-agent","metadata":{"task":"classify_customer_ticket"}}
```

The body is **NDJSON** — one JSON object per line. Line 1 is the trace record; subsequent lines are span records. This format matches the output of `AgentSimulator#emit`.

Response `201 Created`:
```json
{ "trace_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8", "spans_ingested": 1 }
```

---

### Testing

The project uses **RSpec** for testing.

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

Test coverage includes:

* Unit tests for parsing, utility, and analysis classes
* Model specs for `Trace`, `Span`, and `ApiKey`
* Request specs for all API endpoints
* Simulator specs use fixed seeds for deterministic output
